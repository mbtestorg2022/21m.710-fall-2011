Final Project
-------------

The final project will be a response to any one of the plays we have discussed. This can take the form of a design project, a scene performance, an original play that responds to a previous play, a screen or television adaptation, etc.

Each project will be presented to the class, and each project will be accompanied by a paper (10–15 pages), discussing how you utilized the principles of script analysis in your project.

Students may collaborate on these projects. If the project was collaborative, each member of the collaboration must submit a paper.

An example:

[A costume design project for Jean Genet's _The Blacks_ (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit21m_710f11_paper_3)

Evaluation
----------

At the end of the semester, each student will be required to submit a paper (5-7 pages) evaluating the course, reviewing their work in the course, and recording their grade.
